                <h1>About The</h1>
                <p>
                    <h2>What Should I Do</h2>
                    If i learn next js today then again one day will go waste on learning, with one day without any prductivity.
                    <br />
                    It will feel like i am wasting time, because i need to give productivity. I need to prove myself that i am capable of anything.
                    <br />
                    If i do start developing of chasicare and weldx then report it at the end of day, it won't be a satisfactory feeling because it's my personal task and i should make it internally.
                    <br />
                    The focus is on E-mandi website and app, emandi website is being handled by other, and the app as well, until the full website is not complete i can not inspect the code and make changes to it for the production, because it will be difficult to add those one by one instead of once.
                    <br />
                    If i do marble and tile review then it is not in plate for now.
                    <br />
                    I think i should make a quiver design layout, while they are developing the emandi, i will start working on quiver. I will make starting design and layout for it by parallaly learning and applying to the site.
                    <i>if i do this, i will gain experience and skills</i>

            </Layout>
        );
    }
